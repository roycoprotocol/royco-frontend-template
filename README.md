![Royco Banner](./royco-launch-kit.png)

## Introduction

Royco Launch Kit is the easiest way to create your own front end for the Royco Protocol. The Royco Protocol is an open-source protocol that allows anyone to create a marketplace for incentivizing anything. This Launch Kit contains an entirely open-source and free-to-use template for a front-end to access the Royco Protocol.

## Get Started

### Instructions

1. Acquire keys to a Royco SDK. You may either work with someone else running the SDK, or launch your own using the subgraph and connecting it with a pipeline to db using services like Goldksy.

2. Clone this repository and install its dependencies. We are using pnpm as the package manager.

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

4. Build the project.

```bash
pnpm run build
```

5. Run the project..

```bash
npm run start
```

### Environment Variables

Start by copying the example file and modify all the access urls and keys in order to build a fully functional front-end. The sample variables are present in `.env.SAMPLE` file in the root directory.
